//! Spatial data structures.
//!
//! Generic implementations for most common data structures for
//! storing and querying spatial data.
//!
//!
//! Currently implemented data structures are:
//!
//! * `Quadtree`, usually used for partitioning two-dimensional space.
//! * `Octree`, used for partitioning three-dimensional space.
//!
//! # Indexing
//!
//! In order for an *object* to be inserted into a quad- or an octree,
//! it must implement an appropriate `Index`-trait.
//!
//! ```
//! use spatial::quadtree;
//! use spatial::octree;
//!
//! // Our monster can exist in two- or three-dimensional space.
//! struct Monster {
//!     x: f32,
//!     y: f32,
//!     z: f32
//! }
//!
//! impl quadtree::Index<f32> for Monster {
//!     fn quadtree_index(&self) -> [f32, ..2] {
//!         [self.x, self.y]
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl octree::Index<f32> for Monster {
//!     fn octree_index(&self) -> [f32, ..3] {
//!         [self.x, self.y, self.z]
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The `Index`-traits are everything needed to start populating the
//! trees.
